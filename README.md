# Why ?

There seem to be tons for design systems, if you look at the big ones like bootstrap or the ant design system for react and so on and so forth. However, there is none that rely on custom elements / webcomponents. However, this relatively new technology is finally usable all modern browsers and since it is native technology, it is definitively the next big thing. It will eventually make frameworks like React, Angular, Vuejs redundant. Like ES6 did with JQERY. BUT even if it does not, since this UI System is based on fully native technology, it is compatible with any framework/library you are using: Angular, React, VueJS, Dojo, Jquery, Bootstrap, Ember, Mootools, Polymer, AMP, and all old ones and any upcoming new one. It’s here to stay.

Since I’m only one guy working on this currently, I would be very happy if people would join the project and make it a thing. Pull-request are more than welcome.
